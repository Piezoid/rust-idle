# `rust-idle`

*Give a break to your spinning rust.*

`rust-idle` is a small linux daemon that spin down hard drives after a period of
idle time.

`rust-idle` is a reimplementation of *Christian Mueller*'s
[`hd-idle`](http://hd-idle.sourceforge.net/) inspired by [another
reimplementation in go](https://github.com/adelolmo/hd-idle).

### Why?

*Yet another implementation?*

Why not? Rust is well suited for this task and I couldn't let go have it all. üòè

The real reason is that this is meant as an exercise to see how well rust fares
for writing simple and small system daemons that are as lean as possible. A
domain where C is king.

## **Warning**

Frequently spinning down hard drives can quickly wear down the head parking
mechanism. This can potentially offset any cost saving on energy or spindle
wear.

This software is provided *as-is*, without warranty of any kind. The authors
decline all responsibility for any damage resulting from its use.

## Features

* Configurable idle time period and verbosity per hard drive, default settings
  for all other drives,
* Possibility to sync the filesystems on the hard-drive before spinning it down
  and/or after it has waked up. This prevent spurious flushing of dirty pages
  and enables swifter idling,
* Systemd unit file included, log-level formatting for journald,
* Tiny runtime footprint: no allocations during normal operation, unless logging
  is enabled or new drives are hot-plugged; Small binary when built with
  `build-std` (80kB on `x86_64`),
* Like [the go implementation](https://github.com/adelolmo/hd-idle), `rust-idle`
  doesn't monitors activity on root device but instead monitors partitions. This
  prevents false-positives when monitoring daemons like `smartd` or `udiskd`
  query the drive's status registers,
* ‚ùå Monitor and spin down disks connected over USB (planned, not yet
  implemented),
* ‚ùå Has only been tested on `x86_64` linux,
* ‚ùì Any suggestion? Please open an [issue].

## Installation

**dependencies**: `cargo` and `rustc`. For a smaller binary size, `rustup` with
a nightly toolchain is recommended.

On Arch Linux, the `rust-idler-git` package can be built from the AUR, or with
`arch/PKGBUILD` found in this repos.

Cargo can build this project the usual way (`cargo build --release`), however
`build.sh` will try to use the `build-std` feature, if available.

`install.sh` installs the binary, service file, and documentation under
`PREFIX=/usr/local/` by default. To test its behavior, it is possible to run it
as a normal user, with the right environment. For example:

```bash
export DESTDIR="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/testroot" PREFIX=/usr
./install.sh
find "$DESTDIR" -type f
```
```
/run/user/1000/testroot/etc/conf.d/rust-idle
/run/user/1000/testroot/usr/lib/systemd/system/rust-idle.service
/run/user/1000/testroot/usr/share/licenses/rust-idle/LICENSE
/run/user/1000/testroot/usr/share/doc/rust-idle/README.md
/run/user/1000/testroot/usr/bin/rust-idle
```


## Usage

Once installed, the daemon must be enabled and started with:
```
# systemctl enable --now rust-idle
```

With the default configuration under [`/etc/conf.d/rust-idle`](rust-idle.conf),
`rust-idle` waits for 10min of idle time before syncing and spinning down
any SATA drive found on the system.

Behavior can be specialized per device. Setting an idle time of 0 disable any
action. For example:
```
RUST_IDLE_OPTS= :0 /dev/sda:600 /dev/sdb:1200
```
will spin down the drive `sda` after 10min of idle time, `sdb` after 20 min, and
ignore any other drive present in the system.
